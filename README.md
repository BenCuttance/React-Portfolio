# React-Portfolio

## Description

This project is to showcase my news skillset using React and creating single-page applications. Now that the coding course is coming to a close it time to start showcasing my skills and previous applications so that future employers can see my work. This application will showcase my new skills in React using event handling, react forms, props, and conditional rendering  This application will have a header showing navigation titles to an About Me, Portfolio, Resume and Contact Me sections which will allow future employers to see my skills as a junior developer.

## User Story

# Contact Form
Currently the form doesn't send to my email, however I have installed a package and sent up an account that should eaily allow me to recieve emails in the future. The form uses a REGEX to validate the emails, and an error will be sent to users if any of the fields are left empty
